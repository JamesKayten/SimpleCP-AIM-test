## ⚡ EXACT EXIT STATE

### **What I Was Working On:**

- **Created comprehensive task list for OCC** - 6 development areas with 24 specific tasks for overnight credit usage
- **Updated behavior rules** - added verification requirements, file size enforcement, credit maximization protocols

### **Immediate Next Action:**
**SimpleCP is running (daemon at localhost:8080) with comprehensive OCC task list ready. All violations resolved. Project ready for continued development.**

### **Work Progress:**
- ✅ File size violations fixed (274→245 lines)
