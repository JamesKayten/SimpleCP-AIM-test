```markdown
# Getting Started with AI Collaboration Framework

## What You Need

- Git repository (any project)
- Local AI (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) OR Online AI (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- 5 minutes

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Framework

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesKayten/Averys-AI-Collaboration-Hack.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### Step 3: Run the Installer

```bash
../Averys-AI-Collaboration-Hack/install.sh
```

The installer will ask:
- **Project type**: Choose from React, Python, Java, Mobile, Data Science, or Custom
- **Max file size**: Recommended defaults shown for each type
- **Test coverage**: Recommended defaults shown for each type

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
ls docs/
# Should show:
# AI_COLLABORATION_FRAMEWORK.md
# AI_WORKFLOW.md
# ai_communication/
```

## Your First AI Collaboration

### Using Local AI Validation

If you have Claude Code or similar:

1. Open your project in your editor
2. Make some code changes
3. Run: "work ready" (tells Local AI to validate)
4. Local AI will check your code against standards
5. If violations found, report created in `docs/ai_communication/`

### Using Online AI for Fixes

If you have Claude Web or ChatGPT:

1. Tell Online AI: "Check docs/ai_communication/ for latest report"
2. Online AI reads the report
3. Implements fixes based on violations
4. Responds with what was changed

### Validation Loop

1. Online AI makes changes → Creates branch
2. You: "work ready" → Local AI validates
3. Violations found → Report created
4. You tell Online AI about report → Implements fixes
5. You: "work ready" → Local AI validates again
6. No violations → Local AI merges to main

## Customizing for Your Project

### Edit Validation Rules

```bash
edit docs/ai_communication/VALIDATION_RULES.md
```

Customize:
- File size limits per file type
- Test coverage requirements
- Security scanning tools
- Performance benchmarks
- Project-specific standards

### Example: React Project

```yaml
file_size_limits:
  components: 150 lines
  hooks: 100 lines

validation:
  test_coverage: 85%
  bundle_size: 1MB max
  eslint: required
  prettier: required
```

### Example: Python Project

```yaml
file_size_limits:
  modules: 300 lines
  classes: 200 lines

validation:
  test_coverage: 90%
  black: required
  flake8: required
  mypy: required
```

## Troubleshooting

**Installation fails with "Not a git repository"**
- Make sure you're in a git repository
- Run `git init` if starting fresh

**Validation commands not found**
- Install project dependencies first (npm install, pip install, etc.)
- Update validation commands in VALIDATION_RULES.md to match your tools

**Placeholders not replaced**
- Check that install script completed successfully
- Manually replace {{PROJECT_NAME}} if needed

## Next Steps

- Read [AI_WORKFLOW.md](docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md) for detailed workflow
- Customize [VALIDATION_RULES.md](docs/ai_communication/VALIDATION_RULES.md)
- Join [GitHub Discussions](link) for questions
- Check [examples/](link) for project-specific configs

**Create FAQ.md** (2 hours):

```markdown
# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**Q: What AI tools does this work with?**
A: Any combination! Local AI (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) + Online AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) or even just one type. The framework is AI-agnostic.

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: 5 minutes for installation, 15-30 minutes for customization (depending on how much you want to configure).

**Q: Can I use this with existing projects?**
A: Yes! The framework installs into a `docs/` folder and doesn't modify your existing code.

**Q: Does this require cloud services or API keys?**
A: No. It's purely file-based communication. The AIs read/write markdown files in your repository.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Yes. It's been tested on React, Python, and Java projects in production use.

## Installation

**Q: What if I don't have a git repository yet?**
A: Run `git init` in your project directory first, then install the framework.

**Q: Can I install on Windows?**
A: Yes, but you'll need WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash. Native Windows support coming soon.

**Q: What if installation fails?**
A: Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Most common issue is not being in a git repository.

## Usage

**Q: Do I need both Local AI and Online AI?**
A: No. You can use just one, but the collaboration works best with both (Local for validation, Online for implementation).

**Q: How do I customize validation rules?**
A: Edit `docs/ai_communication/VALIDATION_RULES.md` in your project. You can set file size limits, test coverage, and more.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: All of them! The framework is language-agnostic. You just need to configure validation commands for your specific tools.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple projects?**
A: Yes. Install separately in each project and customize rules per project.

## Technical

**Q: How does AI-to-AI communication work?**
A: AIs read and write markdown files in `docs/ai_communication/`. Local AI creates reports, Online AI reads them and responds.

**Q: Does this integrate with CI/CD?**
A: Yes. You can run validation commands in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or any CI/CD platform. See examples/.

**Q: Can I add custom validation scripts?**
A: Yes! Add any scripts to your validation rules. Examples: security scanners, performance tests, custom linters.

**Q: Is this open source?**
A: Yes, MIT licensed. Free to use in personal and commercial projects.

## Contributing

**Q: How can I contribute?**
A: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome validation templates, integration examples, docs improvements, and bug fixes.

**Q: I found a bug, what do I do?**
A: Open an issue on GitHub with reproduction steps. We typically respond within 24 hours.

**Q: Can I suggest features?**
A: Absolutely! Open a feature request issue or start a Discussion.
