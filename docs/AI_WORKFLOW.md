# AI Collaboration Workflow for SimpleCP

## Project Configuration
**Type:** Python Backend/API
**Language:** python
**Max File Size:** 300 lines
**Test Coverage:** 90%
**Validation Tools:** black,flake8,pytest

## "Work Ready" Command Workflow

When you say **"work ready"**, Local AI should execute this automated workflow:

### 1. Check AI Communications
**FIRST:** Check for communications from Online AI
- Check `docs/ai_communication/` for new files since last run
- Process any `AI_RESPONSE_*.md` files (fixes completed)
- Process any `AI_UPDATE_*.md` files (general updates/questions)
- Report AI communications to user

### 2. Repository Branch Inspection
- Check for new branches created by Online AI
- Use `git fetch` to get latest remote branches
- Identify branches that aren't `main` or previously known

### 3. Validation Check
Apply SimpleCP-specific validation rules:

**File Size Limits:**
- Maximum: 300 lines per file
- Check with: `find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.java" | xargs wc -l | awk '$1 > 300 {print "VIOLATION: " $2 " has " $1 " lines (limit: 300)"}'`

**Test Coverage:**
- Minimum: 90% coverage required

**Code Quality Tools:**
- Configured: black,flake8,pytest

### 4. Violation Response
If violations found:
- **STOP** merge process immediately
- Create `docs/ai_communication/AI_REPORT_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Include specific remediation instructions
- Notify user with OCC activation command

### 5. Clean Merge
If all validations pass:
- Merge branch to main
- Push to remote
- Clean up branches
- Report success

## Project-Specific Validation Commands

```bash
black --check .
flake8 --max-line-length=88 .
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90
```
