Post template:
```
Hi HN! I created a framework that enables Local AI (like Claude Code) and Online AI
(like Claude/GPT) to collaborate automatically through repository files.

The problem: Using AI coding assistants requires constant human oversight to catch
quality issues. The solution: Let AIs validate each other's work automatically.

Key features:
- Works with any repository/language
- Parameter-driven setup (file size limits, test coverage, validation tools)
- Preset configurations for React, Python, Java, etc.
- Zero-dependency installation (pure bash)

Born from real-world usage during a React project where coordinating Local and
Online AI became the most productive part of development.

GitHub: [link]
Demo video: [link]

Would love feedback from the HN community on the approach and implementation!
```

**Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST (highest engagement windows)

**C. Reddit Post Strategy**

For r/programming (adapt for other subreddits):

Title: "[Open Source] AI Collaboration Framework - Let Local & Online AI Work Together Automatically"

Template:
```
I've been using Claude Code (local) + Claude/GPT (online) for development and
realized I was manually copying validation reports between them. So I built a
framework to automate this entirely.

**What it does:**
- Local AI validates code against project standards
- Creates structured reports in repository files
- Online AI reads reports and implements fixes
- Continuous quality loop without human copy/paste

**Why it's useful:**
- Works with any AI combination (Claude Code + GPT, Copilot + Claude, etc.)
- Configurable for any language/framework
- 3-step installation, works in 5 minutes
- Completely open source (MIT license)

**Tech stack:** Pure bash installer, markdown-based protocol, git-based workflow

Tested on React/Python/Java projects. Looking for feedback and contributors!

## Conclusion

This strategy prioritizes authentic developer engagement over traditional marketing. The AI coding assistant market is growing rapidly, and there's a clear need for tools that improve AI collaboration.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **High-quality documentation** is critical - developers will judge the tool by its docs
2. **Community engagement** must be genuine - developers detect and reject marketing speak
3. **Consistent content** builds authority - weekly blog posts and tutorials demonstrate expertise
4. **GitHub optimization** drives organic discovery - most developers find tools through GitHub search
5. **Patience and persistence** - open source success takes months, not days

**Expected Timeline to Key Milestones**:
- 100 stars: 4-6 weeks
- 500 stars: 10-14 weeks
- 1,000 stars: 16-24 weeks
- First sponsor: 12-16 weeks
- Self-sustaining community: 6-9 months

The framework has genuine value and solves a real problem. With consistent execution of this strategy, it has strong potential to become a widely-adopted tool in the AI-assisted development ecosystem.

**Next Step**: Begin with documentation improvements (Phase 1) this week, then execute soft launch (Week 3) and major launch (Week 4) according to timeline above.
