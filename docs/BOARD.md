### 🔧 URGENT: Fix Swift Concurrency & Actor Isolation Errors

**Issue:** Additional compilation failures due to Swift concurrency violations

**Files Affected:**
- `frontend/SimpleCP-macOS/Sources/SimpleCP/Services/BackendService.swift` (lines 250-251)
- `frontend/SimpleCP-macOS/Sources/SimpleCP/Services/BackendService+Monitoring.swift` (lines 34, 51, 136, 165)

**Required Changes:**

**BackendService.swift:**
1. Line 250: `cleanupTimers()` - needs `await` or `Task { await cleanupTimers() }`
2. Line 251: `cleanupProcess()` - needs `await` or `Task { await cleanupProcess() }`

**BackendService+Monitoring.swift:**
1. Line 34: `consecutiveFailures` - needs `self.consecutiveFailures` in closure
2. Line 51: `checkBackendStatus()` - needs `await` in async context
3. Line 136: `maxRestartAttempts` - needs `self.maxRestartAttempts` in closure
4. Line 165: `restartCount` & `maxRestartAttempts` - needs `self.` prefix in closure

**Technical Reason:** Swift 5.5+ strict concurrency checking requires explicit self capture and proper async/await usage for main actor methods.

**Verification:** Project should compile without concurrency warnings after changes.

**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING - prevents Swift development
