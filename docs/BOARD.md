## ✅ **TCC /WORKS-READY EXECUTION #6 (2025-12-01)**

**Repository**: smplcp (simple-cp-test)
**Date**: 2025-12-01
**TCC Action**: File size compliance merge successful
**Branch Merged**: claude/check-boa-016Lnpug3PimnfcpWQacMoJU
**Commit Hash**: ffe74bd (Merge branch 'claude/check-boa-016Lnpug3PimnfcpWQacMoJU' - File size compliance achieved)
**Result**: ✅ **MERGE SUCCESSFUL**

### **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**

**✅ FILE SIZE COMPLIANCE COMPLETED:**
- All core Swift files modularized and under 300-line limits
- Python backend files optimized and compliant
- BOARD.md simplified and updated to reflect resolved status
- Repository status changed to: 🟢 **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

### **BRANCH LIFECYCLE COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ **MERGED TO MAIN**
**Remote Branch**: Deleted
**Local Branch**: Deleted
**Board Status**: Updated with completion record

**TCC Status**: ✅ **WORKFLOW UNBLOCKED** - Development can now proceed with compliant codebase

## 🚨 **TCC /WORKS-READY EXECUTION #7 (2025-12-01)**

**Repository**: simple-cp-test
**Date**: 2025-12-01
**TCC Action**: Branch cleanup analysis - MASS CLEANUP REQUIRED
**Branches Found**: 34 claude/* branches with pending commits
**Result**: 🟡 **CLEANUP REQUIRED**

### **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**

**🚨 BRANCH BACKLOG DETECTED:**
- 34 remote claude/* branches contain unremerged commits
- Many branches appear to contain outdated work from pre-reorganization
- Branch dates range from Nov 17 - Nov 30, 2025
- Some contain substantial features (MenuBarApp, advanced search, etc.)

### **ANALYSIS FINDINGS**

**Representative Branch Examined**: `claude/advanced-features-01QejCKQKY6KRopDnFrhYjHa`
- Contains 8 priority features for SimpleCP
- Adds MenuBarApp/, utils/advanced_search.py, analytics
- Based on pre-reorganization codebase structure
- Would conflict with current backend/ organization

### **TCC DECISION**

**❌ MASS AUTO-MERGE REJECTED**: Too risky due to:
- Potential structural conflicts (root vs backend/ organization)
- Large number of branches requiring individual review
- Some work may be superseded by current main branch state
- Board shows "No Pending Tasks" - suggests branches may be stale

### **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OCC**

1. **Systematic Branch Review**: Examine each branch for:
   - Structural compatibility with current codebase
   - Feature overlap with existing functionality
   - Value of work vs current main branch state

2. **Cleanup Strategy**:
   - Identify truly stale branches for deletion
   - Rebase valuable features onto current main
   - Update board with legitimate pending work

3. **Workflow Fix**: Investigate why 34 branches accumulated without board tracking

**TCC Status**: ✅ **ANALYSIS COMPLETE** - OCC action required for branch management

## 🔄 **TCC /WORKS-READY EXECUTION #8 (2025-12-01)**

**Repository**: simple-cp-test
**Date**: 2025-12-01
**TCC Action**: Branch status re-check post-analysis
**Branches Found**: 37 claude/* branches (+3 since last analysis)
**Result**: 🟡 **SAME CONCLUSION MAINTAINED**

### **STATUS UPDATE**

**🔄 BRANCH COUNT INCREASED:**
- Previous analysis (TCC #7): 34 branches
- Current count: 37 branches (+3 additional)
- Same structural risk assessment applies

### **TCC DECISION**

**❌ MASS AUTO-MERGE STILL REJECTED**: Previous analysis remains valid:
- Structural conflicts with current backend/ organization
- Pre-reorganization codebase conflicts
- Board shows "No Pending Tasks" - branches appear stale
- Risk assessment unchanged by +3 branch increase

### **CONFIRMED STATUS**

**OCC Action Required**: Branch management strategy needed before any merges
**TCC Status**: ✅ **MONITORING COMPLETE** - Awaiting OCC branch review decisions

## 🔄 **TCC /WORKS-READY EXECUTION #9 (2025-12-01)**

**Repository**: simple-cp-test
**Date**: 2025-12-01
**TCC Action**: Re-validation of pending branches post-compliance
**Branches Found**: 37 claude/* branches (unchanged from execution #8)
**Result**: 🟡 **NO ACTION TAKEN - PREVIOUS ANALYSIS UPHELD**

### **STATUS CONFIRMATION**

**🔄 BRANCH STATUS UNCHANGED:**
- Same 37 remote claude/* branches as previous analysis
- Most recent branch: `claude/session-restore-documentation-014CJUcRqwetMNMYrzwPMSwe` (Nov 30)
- Branch contains file size compliance violations (merge blocked)
- No new legitimate work detected

### **TCC DECISION MAINTAINED**

**❌ MASS AUTO-MERGE STILL REJECTED**: Original analysis remains valid:
- File size compliance already achieved in main branch (execution #6)
- No pending tasks on board indicating ready work
- Structural conflicts with current backend/ organization persist
- Risk of merging stale pre-reorganization work unchanged

### **KEY FINDING**

**✅ CURRENT STATUS VERIFIED:**
- Main branch is healthy with file size compliance complete
- Board correctly shows "No Pending Tasks"
- Repository status correctly shows "🟢 READY FOR DEVELOPMENT"
- No legitimate work awaiting merge

**TCC Status**: ✅ **VALIDATION COMPLETE** - No merge action required, awaiting OCC branch cleanup
