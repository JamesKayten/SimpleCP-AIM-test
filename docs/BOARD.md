## Project Components

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **FastAPI REST server** - localhost:8000
- **Clipboard monitoring** - Real-time capture
- **JSON storage** - History management
- **Test suite** - Comprehensive coverage

### Frontend (`/frontend/SimpleCP-macOS`)
- **MenuBar app** - Native SwiftUI
- **REST client** - Backend integration
- **User interface** - 600x400 window

## 🚨 **TCC /WORKS-READY EXECUTION #7 (2025-12-01)**

**Repository**: simple-cp-test
**Date**: 2025-12-01
**TCC Action**: Branch cleanup analysis - MASS CLEANUP REQUIRED
**Branches Found**: 34 claude/* branches with pending commits
**Result**: 🟡 **CLEANUP REQUIRED**

### **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**

**🚨 BRANCH BACKLOG DETECTED:**
- 34 remote claude/* branches contain unremerged commits
- Many branches appear to contain outdated work from pre-reorganization
- Branch dates range from Nov 17 - Nov 30, 2025
- Some contain substantial features (MenuBarApp, advanced search, etc.)

### **ANALYSIS FINDINGS**

**Representative Branch Examined**: `claude/advanced-features-01QejCKQKY6KRopDnFrhYjHa`
- Contains 8 priority features for SimpleCP
- Adds MenuBarApp/, utils/advanced_search.py, analytics
- Based on pre-reorganization codebase structure
- Would conflict with current backend/ organization

### **TCC DECISION**

**❌ MASS AUTO-MERGE REJECTED**: Too risky due to:
- Potential structural conflicts (root vs backend/ organization)
- Large number of branches requiring individual review
- Some work may be superseded by current main branch state
- Board shows "No Pending Tasks" - suggests branches may be stale

### **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OCC**

1. **Systematic Branch Review**: Examine each branch for:
   - Structural compatibility with current codebase
   - Feature overlap with existing functionality
   - Value of work vs current main branch state

2. **Cleanup Strategy**:
   - Identify truly stale branches for deletion
   - Rebase valuable features onto current main
   - Update board with legitimate pending work

3. **Workflow Fix**: Investigate why 34 branches accumulated without board tracking

**TCC Status**: ✅ **ANALYSIS COMPLETE** - OCC action required for branch management
